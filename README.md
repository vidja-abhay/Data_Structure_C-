# C++ Data Structures Collection

This repository contains a collection of common data structure implementations in C++. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing fundamental data structures.

## Data Structures Included

- Stack
- Binary Tree
- Graph
- Linked List
- Binary Search Tree
- Trie
- Queue
- Hashing

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) or any C++ compiler
- Visual Studio Code (or any preferred code editor)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository : https://github.com/vidja-abhay/Data_Structure_C-.git

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code or your preferred IDE.

3. Ensure your C++ compiler is properly set up in your development environment.

## Usage

Each data structure is implemented in its own .cpp file. To run a specific implementation:

1. Open the desired .cpp file in your IDE.
2. Compile the file using your C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
